The code under this file was produced for the unit, Mathematical and Data Modeling, in year 3, Engineering Maths, University of Bristol.
The title of the project is 'Improving and Optimising Compression Methodologies for 3D Environmental AerospaceData'.
The raw data was provided by zenotech, which cannot be published.
All codes under this file with .jl ending were created by the study group of Zenotech.
All codes under this file with .py ending were created by me(Brenda Duan) with help from others.
'ESGIZenotech.py' was the python version translated from 'ESGIZenotech.jl', most of the origin functions were translated.
My part was optimize the octree method for data compression.
The outcome indicated that compress data using python would be very slow, however some features of python and libraries in python could lead to a better compression rate.
The codes for the whole project can be found at [ https://github.com/lippoben/Zenotech---MDM3 ]
