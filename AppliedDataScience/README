The code under this file was produced for the unit, Applied Data Science, in year 3, Engineering Maths, University of Bristol.
All codes under this file were finished by me (Brenda Duan) individually.
The aim for this project is to build a model that can identify whether a food product has safety issue by the comments given by amazon users.
My part was the analysis method about NLP and sentiment analysis, the codes for the whole project can be found at [ https://github.com/mwood1212/ADS-Group-Project ]
The source data was provided by the uni and an alumini in Amazon, which can be found at [ https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html ]
The 'selected_review.csv' includes the comments indicated safety issues of some food products selected manually, which was used for training.
The outcome indicated that sentiment anlysis model performed well.
