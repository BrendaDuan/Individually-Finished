Disgusting now and difficult on digestion. Used to be a decent product.  Disgusting now and difficult on digestion.  All 3 purchased from Costco over past couple months end in same result -- open the container and it smells like rancid oil.  Something not right about how they are making/processing this powder now.  Will not buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had purchased this product before and been very happy.. I had to throw away one 8 pack of this juice because it was moldy and I didn't want to unwrap the pack and be exposed to the mold. Not sure why this happened. I had purchased this product before and been very happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale,nearly expired product that I cannot return. It was 3 days before its expiration date and yep, tasted stale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible - do NOT recommend. Was looking for an alternative to juicing when I travel - this is NOT the winner.  Taste was horrible and there was some odd taste in the powder - it seemed as if it was artificial maybe - it was just not right.  Threw the container away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't Help In My Case. Thought it would help with my eczema.  Took it orally and as emollient.  Made my symptoms worse.  Perhaps, others will have better results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food was bad. They had mold on them had to throw away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HORRIBLE PRODUCT SMELLS AWFUL. Bought this before and was able to put it in yoghurt and pur&eacute;ed foods for my toddlers. This last batch smells like feaces!!! i was wondering why my toddlers were refusing foods they normally like and I finally tried tasting it and felt bad I wasn't cognizant of how terrible this was!!! Needless to say won't be purchasing again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. the packing did not had any manufacturing date and the tea was not fresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Will never buy again. Tasted burned and I believe they were expired.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soy milk was spoiled. Had to throw it away .... Soy milk was spoiled.  Had to throw it away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not buy !. Something wrong with this vanilla. Unfortunately I used it in a jar of homemade coffee creamer. Had to throw the creamer out. Now am throwing the entire bottle out as it is spoiled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maltodextrin is a questionable ingredient. Contains maltodextrin which causes upset stomach and even dizziness in some people (me, for one).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Floating ""Dirt"" or ""Mold"" Inside Bottle!. I was drinking a bottle of this and I noticed black stuff floating at the bottom of the bottle.  A few of the bottles remaining in the case had some of this stuff.  I threw it all away.<br /><br />I never post reviews.  This shouldn't be sold this way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ALL Truffle Oils Are Made From Chemicals. This tastes good but I got extremely sick both times I used it, and later learned that truffle oils are made from chemicals (usually petroleum by-products.) Google it. The chemicals make some people ill.  Granted, this company puts a tiny piece of a truffle in the bottle but that doesn't make it any more authentic than a bottle of tequila with a worm in it.  Again, it tastes good. So does antifreeze. Again, Google it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. The dried porcinies arrived molded and they all had to be trown away... Big dissapointment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just, no.. Arrived beat all to hell. Hardly any of the colorful coatings were intact. I returned it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not too happy!!!. This cereal had past it's fresh date 😩.  It was a month past it's date!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My bag was not fresh. I ordered this 5lb bag of Blue Raspberry Jolly Ranchers and also two 2lb bags of Watermellon Jolly Ranchers from a different seller. I have never ordered from this seller before. Both orders of Jolly Ranchers were delivered together at the same time. But the bag of Blue Raspberry were not fresh. I could tell right away when I first looked at them, they looked melted. I hoped that they might be just a little sticky, but they weren't,they also had a nasty chewy film on them like they were old. So I am returning them. It is unfortunate because this really would have been a great deal for 5lbs.<br />The Watermellon that I ordered from a different seller arrived perfectly fresh, as always.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. THe second bag that I bought had sooooo many bad ones in them. THey were aweful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The coffee was roasted almost 2 years ago. has .... The  coffee was roasted almost 2 years ago. has a mold and mildew taste, (NASTY). This product should not be sold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have always loved this chocolate and only occasionally received a stale bar. The chocolate I received was old and stale. I should have returned it. It was offered on sale with a lower than usual price, that should have tipped me off. But the offer did not mention that it was outdated or old, so I consider this a very negative experience. I have always loved this chocolate and only occasionally received a stale bar. This one was egregious and on the very edge of fraudulent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weird taste. I stock and use dry milk occasionally. Have tried Nido before but this one had a very weird taste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOT PEANUT FREE!. I won't buy this item again because it's processed in a factory that also handles<br />Peanuts. Why not protect children and adults from a possible reaction by taking measures to separate peanut items from non-peanut items?<br />It's too bad, I will not buy again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Product arrived 4 months past &#34;best by date of May 5th&#34;. Must not believe in stock rotation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was expired when I recieved it!. I am thoroughly disappointed as I recieved an expired bottle!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spoiled. This product has gone bad before it even got to me. Completely a brown yellow liquid. I've never seen coconut oil this color and it won't go back to a solid. Not good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale, don't order from this company.. This food arrived with a near expiration date and half of the items are stale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
old product. It was almost expired 2 months!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do Not Buy. This product is not fresh! Smells like dirt. Tastes like dirt. This is nothing like 100% organic schizandra! Very disappointed. My body recognized this product as poison! There definitely are fillers in this product from China! Do Not Buy! Buy instead 100% organic-no fillers- schizandra from Lucidera! Not this company!<br />I know my health products & this is not one of them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale. It was stale. The chocolate was old and crumbling. Not like what they have regularly at the supermarket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. It had expired three weeks ago. Very old stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They tasted stale. I have ordered these before from .... They tasted stale. I have ordered these before from somewhere else and these just about broke my teeth they were so hard..... will not order again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Past Code. Product was delivered in late August with an expiration date of June of the same year.  Very disappointed, will be returning and it will affect my future purchasing decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Unable to use--covered in mold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rancid nuts in package. Had rancid nuts in package.<br />Not what I expect when I buy a food product.<br />Very dissatisfied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost barfed!. MOLD! First one I opened had spots of mold growing on it. Unfortunately I ate about half before noticing. I haven't thrown up since 1996 but let me tell you this: I was tested that day...like Jerry Seinfeld eating a black & white cookie. I contacted Amazon and they are issuing me a refund. Still super gross.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stale product. Tried it for the second time.  The second batch was stale . Won't order this brand again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not happy. The one I got was expired by 6 months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
God Awful. Oh my god, this tea was disgusting and wreaked havoc on my stomach. I'm honestly not sure what I thought I was buying,but I didn't know it was one of those teas that make you run to the bathroom every 5 seconds, which is what this is. Even if that's what you're looking for, I still wouldn't advise you to buy this. It tastes so awful.<br /><br />I threw all of it away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale Chips. Received on July 18th and opened 6 bags on August 20-25.  All were so stale as to be inedible.  Do not recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very bad spoiled when received had to send back awful taste. Very bad spoiled when received had to send back awful taste. Company okay with return had expiration date June 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale expired chips were sent.. Sent entire bag of chips that expired March 10,2015 (and its August 28th,2015.  Price was cheap with international shipping, only took about a week and a half.  Were slightly stale and flavors seemed subdued,perhaps due to the expiration.  Not worth the hassle of trying to return. You get what you pay for ($11.43 including shipping),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yuck. Horrible product. Chocolate was old and crusty, tasted stale. Many pieces were melted together in large clumps. Yuck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 months beyond expiration eat.. Just received these today is 08/27/15. the product best sale date was 03/23/2015.  That is 5 months beyond freshness date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made my baby sick. I was happy with these at first,but my 10 month old had two and then 6 ozs of formula and became cranky. About an hour later she threw up the two teething wafers only. Not for sure if those are what caused it, but I tried giving one to her two days later and she absolutely refused it. She even shuttered when she took a taste before refusing it. It may not be the product but maybe she has a sensitivity to rice or some other ingredient in them. Better off anyways since we don't, especially her, need to be consuming rice products often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a waste of money. Out dated, stale and one bag was pop open, had to trash all of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad Batch. I have been purchasing this product often on for a few years. I have been a big fan of them. I don't know what happened this time around, but the batch I got was basically all burnt on the inside of each piece. I was very disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It literally tasted like right after you vomit. Not sure if I got a rancid batch, but I ate one chip and had to return them. It literally tasted like right after you vomit.  My coworkers agreed. Either it is the odd combo of flavors and heat, but I would never recommend trying these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed and upset. I had ordered 12 jars of the assorted Earthbest baby food. Out of 12 jars 4 of them were damaged. One of the jar was completely rotten inside and was halfway filled to the top. I am very disappointed and upset. I do not recommend ordering from this person and will not be making future purchases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expired coffee. Do not buy this coffee from this vendor it didn't even come in a Starbucks box old coffee has no flavor supposed to be a dark roast absolutely brown water nothing like a true fresh Starbucks coffee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stale and rock hard. Package arrived open - figs were stale and rock hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can´t return the product because I am in Mexico and the date for the returning was before august 30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old and stale. Must have sat in a hot .... Old and stale. Must have sat in a hot warehouse or been scraped from the bottom of a barrel somewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mold and/or something gross floating on most of the unopened bottles. Nasty floating moldy stuff in this water.....disgusting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crackers from Amazon are stale. Despite they haven't past the expiration date yet, the crackers I received are stale. Only one box out of six was good. I tried to eat the stale ones but I couldn't, the rancid taste was there. I trashed them. Waste of money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love it - my gut hates it!. I loved this product and drank it every day for months. Started having diarrhea all the time and couldn't figure it out until a friend said she had read about the sweetener erythritol and the negative side effects including diarrhea. Stopped drinking it and the diarrhea went away. This is a great tasting beverage but I can't live with the sweetener!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Made me sick. This Vegemite made me very ill. I broke out in hives and got a massive headache. I must be allergic to it. I tried to return it but was not able too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yuck!. For milk that has an expiration date of nearly a year from now, this stuff tastes spoiled. It's really gross and I can't recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really wanted to love these. They smelled rancid as soon as I .... Really, really wanted to love these. They smelled rancid as soon as I opened the bag, and they tasted rancid, too, and too peppery. I have been searching for chicharrones fried in lard, but I will return to Bacon's Heir chicharrones that, even though they're cooked in olive oil which I do not like, taste much better than these. As far as these go, perhaps I will make powder out of them to use as breading...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Too hard. Too hard. There is no way you can snack on these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't even think about it. I purchased this capsule dispenser from another seller. I have only bad things to say about it. First, there is no glass. I get it, it's the collection's name but still; for this price,you'd expect more than just plastic. The look is not bad which is why I purchased it in the first place but functionality is the worst I have ever seen. Capsules will simply not stay in the tray if you put more than 4 or 5 of them. The reason is that capsules in the top cylinder push those in the tray out which seems to defy the purpose of the dispenser. It's like the &#34;designers&#34; never tried this product once. I have some news for you A&P Cahen Design: design is just not about look, it is also about functionality otherwise it would be called art. It took me one sleeve to realize how bad this product was. How can you put on the market such POC? This goes to Nespresso too who put its name on a product that simply doesn't work. Shame on you both!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not really a cookie. Kinda plastic or waxy tasting/feel in the mouth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not Fresh. When the walnuts arrived, I tried them and they tasted old. Bitter taste. These were not fresh as other packages just like this I had bought from Costco. Disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do not bother getting this. The coffee beans were stale, I can't believe I paid what I did for a terrible cup of coffee. Maxwell House would have tasted better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale!. They may be good, but neither had air tight cellophane bags inside and both were stale and soggy! yuck :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rotten peanut butter and paint. As a vegetarian making the transition to vegan, I had sooooo hoped to like this. Sadly,it was the worst tasting vegan alternative I have ever tasted. I used vegan earth balance butter and coconut milk. It tasted like a mixture of rotten peanut butter and paint. I will never ever buy again. I have 2 boxes now i will never use. Very disappointed because i really wanted to like this :( macaroni and cheese is one of my favorite foods and I'm quite sad I may not find a fitting alternative.<br /><br />Update: for the record, to the rude reviewer commenting on my choice of milk,I have tried soy milk and also almond milk as well (I had 2 boxes left over so I tried to make it work.) To my dismay, it tasted exactly the SAME as it did with coconut milk. Disgusting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. This popcorn I received expired May 15th 2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Disgusting.. came in greatly packaged, but when I opened it half the pouches were leaking! Will not buy again..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old expired product, rancid.. The chips arrived in a simple aluminum wholesale bag. The bag was cut and some chips spilled all over the packaging box. The okra chips are stale, taste very bitter and smell and taste of rancid oil. Inedible.<br />I'm requesting a full refund.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expired coffee, not good!. Was expired when it arrived. Very disappointed! Bag was flat and collapsed of all air. Will not be ordering again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. It has expired when I received it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tastes old & stale. So disappointed in this highly rated coffee assortment... Every single cup tastes old and stale. All of the flavors I was so excited about just taste syrupy and flat. I am not sure what the heck I am going to do with 75 disgusting k-cups now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Check your ""use by date"". I love these bars as I am a diabetic. This time the bar just did not taste the same. Checked the Use By Date and found that they were eight months out of date. I am very disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My mother and grandmother tried these a couple of days ago and experienced the worst pain ever. DO NOT BUY THESE!! My mother and grandmother tried these a couple of days ago and experienced the worst pain ever!!! My poor grandmother was in so much pain that she nearly passed out. I do not understand why these are still out on the market!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Product was received and was out of &#34;USE BY DATE&#34; by 1 year :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I expect much better for anything brought from Amazon. Stale, very stale. I expect much better for anything brought from Amazon. Did I mention they were very stale., because they were very stale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brain freeze for your throat. These things make your mouth and throat so cold it literally causes a brain freeze type pain that doesn't go away for about 30 minutes. Ice breakers should not even be still making these, what the hell are they doing selling these? Have tried all the flavors, they all do the same thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STALE PRODUCT...unfortunate because BB is really good stuff.. I LOVE Brownie Brittle.  I need to have them in individual packets so that I can control myself. That is why I ordered from Amazon.<br /><br />I was sent a STALE product in a re-taped, tampered box. Shame on you Amazon for sending this out.  Clearly, the box,which has an expiration date of November 14,2015 was reused - I tried to find a date on the individual packets but they are not stamped with a date and are clearly old.<br /><br /> I guess that is a way to stay on a diet plan...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mine were rotten and tasted horrible.... I am Turkish and I've never had any problems with Marmarabirlik olives in my whole life.  HOWEVER, this is the first time I've ordered them online and I have to say there were the worst olives I've ever tasted.  They were rotten!  My Mom even commented that these olives are bad.  Maybe I got a bad batch because this company makes one of the very best Turkish olives on the market.  I'm extremely disappointed with this online order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Arrived full of mold.  What more can I say!  Except,I lost $25!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Think twice about ordering in hot weather. I guess I shouldn't have ordered these in summer.  They arrived black with mold on the stem. I had to trash the entire batch but might try again in winter since other buyers have had better luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. When I received the package the 3 sauces included were all expired by 2 months already.  Thumbs down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Box says expires April 2016 but already rancid. Halfway through a box that expires April 2016 the bars have gone rancid. They were stored in a cool dry place so there is no reason for them to go bad so quickly. These are very expensive bars to be throwing in the trash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yuk!. I bought this once and it was horrible. right at the edge of what I would call rancid. I tried it once and threw the rest out, Sorry, I have to tell what I experienced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I HAVE A FRIEND LAST THURSDAY WHO AFTER EATING THIS .... I HAVE A FRIEND LAST THURSDAY WHO AFTER EATING THIS STUFF WAS RUSH TO THE HOSPITAL IN PASADENA CA THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WAS THERE CLOSE TO DEATH, DO NOT EAT THIS PRODUCE.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love the taste but had bad stomach issues after. My local grocery store had a promotion so I was excited to try a new coconut drink. I got a bottle and about an hour after drinking I got very upset stomach, bloating etc. I would encourage to try it as a sample before buying a big batch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sprouts with bugs, rot and MAGGOTS!. Every type of seed I bought from this company was horrible.  First I got flying bugs,then MAGGOTS!  Then the greens would begin to rot.  I tried this 6 times, with different seeds each time.  The worst seeds were the sunflower.  I believe this is where the problem originated.  I got the bugs even in a closed glass jar!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. not to fresh. I will not be buying these again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HORRIBLE gas and constipation. I had to give this one star because I had no other choice....I wish they had negative stars. This formula was HORRIBLE for my 6 week old. He had the worst gas and it constipated him so badly he couldn't stop crying from the pain. The formula is really thick and doesn't mix as well as other formulas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Received EXPIRED product. I purchased this in mid-Aug and I just received the package with a large sticker on it saying it expired in July.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DON'T BUY!!!!. NASTY! I got this for my little sister and when we opened the box.<br />1. There was mold!<br />2. Box was small and beaten up looking.<br />3. Came like a month after the shipping date!<br />4. JUST DON'T BUY!!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale. What a bummer.. It was stale. Like, the dried cranberries were so hard my husband almost broke a tooth. This has happened a couple of times with Udi's granola for us. So we've stopped buying it from Amazon. Bummer, because the pricing makes it so much more reasonable than at the grocery store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Beware of mold!!!. I'm not sure how well my picture showed up, but as I was finishing my bottle of water,my husband asked &#34;What's floating in your water?&#34; Looking at it, we found a ton of disgusting, fuzzy mold and mold spores at the bottom of the bottle of water. I checked the remaining bottles of water from this box and they all had the same thing.  I had just received a new box of this water that I ordered the other day that I'm going to go check now! GROSS!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Gass and upset stomach.  Dont do it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This packaging have warning on it (is different than one on website). is suppose to be healthy food, but label say:<br />THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOW TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM.<br />in this case we don't know which chemicals because they are not listed. I'm returning this product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. not consumable. mushrooms were moldy when received.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thought they smelled a little funny. When I tasted a piece. The nuts inside this product were stale.  As soon as I received the case (pkg of 10 bars) I opened the first 5, broke them into chunks and put them in an air tight container as I usually do.  Thought they smelled a little funny.  When I tasted a piece, the nuts in them tasted stale.  I checked the expiration date and found they were due to expire in four days.  When purchasing this item, the expiration date did not show in any of the pictures.  I will not order from this company again. The other five that I did not open will be pitched as I will probably not be able to return them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
( so I'll give ou a bad review. This product came already open and dates were spilled in the amazon box :( so I'll give ou a bad review<br /><br />thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MILDEWED!!!!. These were TERRIBLE! hHalf of them were MILDEWED and had to be thrown out. Very disappointing. I would like my money back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible smell and taste, perhaps rancid, can't say.. All I can say is the smell alone was so horrible, I was very hesitant to even taste it let alone cook with it. I am glad I did taste it first because it would have completely ruined the meal I was preparing. The smell is extremely strong almost fishy, I don't know how else to describe it. The taste was even more alarming and sent me running to the sink to rinse it out of my mouth. I use flax seed all the time and it tastes nothing at all like this. Maybe this arrived rancid who knows but If it's that perishable, I have no use for it rancid or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not fresh! What I got was probably expired months .... Not fresh!<br />What I got was probably expired months before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spoiled product-be careful. We ordered these just a month ago.  And I opened them today and they are rancid-both smell and taste.  I am so glad I did not give them to my daughters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unhappy. 75% of the product was rotten and unusable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inedible.  Mold? Chemicals?  Asking for my money back.. Something was wrong with these walnuts.  I have had wild walnuts before and these were radically different.  There was a heavy synthetic chemical overtone.  I do not think they are safe to eat.  I was not surprised to find very negative reviews.  My family thought it was mold.  I am going to ask for my money back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Warning; Inventory Clearance Expiration Imminent. I can honestly say they are dry and stale tasting, perhaps due to expiration date just two weeks away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From 5 stars to 1 star. I have ordered this several times and the quality is unpredictable. Thise it was sludge and had a film of oil when added to coffee. I have previously rated it 5 stars, excellent quality. I don't know whs wrong here. Beyond disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lousy Lychees.. When I received and opened my order of Melissa's lychee fruits earlier today,they all had mold on them and most were rotten and very soft. Will NOT be ordering these so called &#34;fresh&#34; lychees again. . Greatly disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Not sure if it was the batch that i got or what, but it actually made me physically ill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale cookies. Stale!  Bought for a birthday party and guests were spitting them out in their napkins.  A little embarrassing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't recommend!!. Ordered these and it was moldy and in date! Don't recommend!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contains unexpected allergens. Many people with dangerous peanut and cashew allergies can have almonds!  Almond butter is a staple in our house. Why put cashews in it without putting in the name!! Sent my 8 year old to the ER. Not ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rotten noodles!. I've enjoyed Annie Chun's products for years, but I won't ever buy again. I bought two packages of my favorite Peanut Sesame noodle bowl. The first one was tasteless compared to my prior purchases. For two weeks I have tried to find the source of the bad smell in my pantry, thinking it was a spoiled potato. Tonight before I even opened the peanut sesame package I smelled what I would describe as a dead rat that had been deceased a long time. When I opened the inner container, I could see the noodles were completely rotten and probably full of worms even though the packaging material had no visible puncture. Glad the trash man is coming tomorrow. Sayonara, Annie Chun, it was nice knowing you, at least at first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chemical smell & aftertaste!. It might be BPA free, but the box it is in is lined w/ aluminum foil. Therefore, pick your poison. I don't want BPA in my food, but I also don't want aluminum in my food. With that being said, there is a chemical smell & a chemical aftertaste in this coconut milk (I am very sensitive to chemicals so if you are not then the coconut taste in this milk may disguise the chemicals enough for you, but why you'd want to ingest toxic chemicals is beyond me). I'm not sure where the chemicals are coming from...perhaps the glue used to apply the aluminum foil to the inside of the cardboard box??? Could be anything. Waste of money for me. I won't risk ingesting this stuff or feeding it to my family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Horrible. it was melted and had mold. Horrible.it was melted and had mold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought a 50-packets box of Whole Earth Pure Via .... I bought a 50-packets box of Whole Earth Pure Via Stevia and started using it in my coffee on Monday of this week.  It's now Friday and I now realize why I have a constant bitter taste in my saliva.  It's all day and into the evening even though I only use this stevia once in the morning at 7 am.

This was disgusting. The chocolate tastes like plastic and not like .... This was disgusting. The chocolate tastes like plastic and not like chocolate at all. Overall, the candy was sickly sweet. Both of my kids turned up their noses after one bite, and they each have a serious sweet tooth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It came with a white film because it had melted .... It came with a white film because it had melted at one point. It was inedible and gross. Returned. Yuck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not like normal figs. Weird, mushy, and gross. Not like normal figs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What about them Apples?. The assortment in this bag was abysmal. It was 90% lemonhead, and ZERO % Applehead, which is the ONLY reason I bought it, for jumbo Appleheads. And I got zero. Plus lots of the pieces were melted and old, or with ripped wrapping and melted goo leaking out. Very poor representation of an otherwise terrific candy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad batch. The water I received was in the lot that was recalled last year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not original Wu Yi. I think the tea contains Ephedrine salt which increased my BP and cause tachycardia.lt doesn't look like the original Wu Yi tea anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Three years beyond freshness date posted on the carton which was covered up by a paper label.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be wary of these, and Walmart sells them cheaper. First of all, I know it's always risky ordering food online. These, and some other colors, were purchased to decorate a birthday cake. The package arrived on time and looked fine but when I opened them to use them they were covered in a slimy whitish goo. It did not smell good and I washed one off and tried it and it did not taste right. I completely cleaned the red off of a few and they tasted fine but were unusable for what I needed. I was not able to return them and got stuck washing all the red off and putting them in cookies. If you're going to buy these, be ware! Luckily for me, that same day I discovered Walmart sells them for almost half the price and I was able to finish the birthday cake as planned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Past expiration date?. They were extremely old and stale. The green was faded and the chocolate was pale, dry, and crumbling. I could not give them to my students because it was just too embarassing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Worst coconut water I have ever tried.  May have even been spoiled, it tastes really awful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tastes Stale.. The roast date was July 14,I received it on August 19.  The coffee tastes stale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yuck. I like just about any type of cheese and maybe I received a box of really stale, rotten snacks, but regardless, these are pretty bad.  I'll stick with Moon Cheese!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Peanuts were stale not fresh I was disappointed.  Ed baron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremely stale Peru.... I buy coffee from many roasters, usually smaller, local companies, although Fresh Roasted Coffee Llc on Amazon is almost always excellent as well.  Thought i would give this company a try...<br /><br /> I received the coffee three days ago, and the roast color was appropriate for a very light roast (which i selected - it's my favorite), so that was good, but there was almost no aroma whatsoever.  Also,the bag was virtually vacuum sealed.  Any coffee roasted within even 3 weeks emits some CO2, which is why the bags puff up when you get fresh coffee.  Even if they pushed all the air out before shipment, after a couple days shipping,the beans emitted no CO2? Bad news bears, as my grandma used to say...<br /><br />The proof is in the pudding, though, so i put some in my burr grinder and got started brewing a couple cups to try.  Once again, when pouring over the freshly ground beans,zero CO2 (when it bubbles and froths a bit - again, this is a sign of fresh roasted coffee).  And guess what, folks?. The coffee tasted stale. I mean, *really* stale.  A fresh, light roasted Peru is usually an awesome cuppa, but this was not even close. No aroma, just a quick hit of papery acidity and a brief hint of the milk chocolate it probably would've had tons of...six weeks ago.<br /><br />Judging by the many great reviews here,I'm guessing this must've been some unfortunate mistake. Based on my experiences buying coffee from 11 different roasters this year alone,I'm confident that the coffee i received was roasted over 6 weeks ago (or *maybe* four weeks ago &it was improperly stored in a 110°F warehouse all through July...who knows?).  Since their whole marketing claim is that they roast it when you order it, this is not right.<br /><br />I tried to contact them first, because i always like to give sellers a chance to respond before leaving negative public feedback. But, their contact link is not working, and they have no online presence except Twitter, and no website.  So, here it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Clumped up Jelly Bellies. Although it stated that it was expired yet, some of the jelly beans were starting to disintegrate & clumped up together. Couldn't use it for my jelly belly dispenser unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One Star. I enjoy the actual product. However,seller sent 72 cups two months past their expiration date. Description says new. False advertising.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Everything was melted and a mess.  Threw it all away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cancer warning label on this product. I am not happy to see this warning that says: &#34;This product contains chemicals known to State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.&#34; I'm extremely upset to see this and was not shown on the product photographs. I also don't know if the chemicals is referring to the nori itself or the preservative packet inside. In any case, this certainly does not make me want to even open this product, much less eat it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not good quality. They smelled muskie when I opened the bag. I spit out the first peace because it did not taste like any of the other Goji berry brand I have purchased before, and the muskie smell concerned me. Also, they were dry, dry, dry!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
caused a migraine. Every time I have tried this product I end up with a headache.  I tried drinking 1/4 and I slept but woke up with a slight headache each time; I didn't correlate the two until one night I drank 1/2 of one and woke up an hour later with the worst migraine I have ever had.  Wish I could just return the bottles I'll never use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dates feel like they have been soaked in sugar water for days. Broken bag.<br />The dates are all squeezed together and become a date paste, instead of individual dates one by one.<br />Dates feel like they have been soaked in sugar water for days, the skins are not whole and many pits fall out.<br />Terrible experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Juice Cleanse product review. Didn't realize it was pasteurized & had expiration date in 2017. Would have preferred something raw fresh & natural that was freshly frozen instead of pasteurized. It said no added sugar but it was very sweet & after 2 day cleanse I only lost .8 lbs. would not order again. I ordered because it was cheaper than the other 3 day raw natural juice cleanse but the raw natural 3 day cleanse tasted raw & natural and I lost 6 lbs on that one. Guess you get what you pay for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Traces of dairy present!  =O. States &#34;no trace of dairy&#34; but my body reacted after eating a handful of these pretzels. Flavor is good,but this product is dangerous to any who are extremely sensitive to cross-contamination (mine is due to ongoing chemotherapy). I contacted the manufacturing company and got this reply:<br /><br />&#34;Thank you for your recent email regarding the “ou dairy” symbol on our packaging.<br /><br />Even though the ingredients in the product you have may not list any dairy ingredients, the product could have been manufactured on a piece of equipment that also produces products with dairy in them. We do share equipment but take stringent measures to clean all equipment between product changes and trust that this information is helpful to you.<br /><br />Thank you for your interest in Snyder’s-Lance,Inc.&#34;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale. These are really close to their expiration date; they taste stale. Will not purchase online again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Like really bad left-overs.... *Update* Originally I gave this 2 stars,but after my stomach attempted to digest this stuff I downgraded to 1 star. I felt sick and had acid reflux. Not good.  ---------------------------------------- I have quite a few gripes about this product,so I will start with something good instead. The one positive I can see is that it is very convenient and easy if you are in a rush. You microwave the pouch for 1 minute,let it sit for 1 minute and you can easily eat it out of the pouch. Now for the problems... It's just plain gross. I couldn't get a handle on the flavor and realized there is very little flavor. It tastes powdery and highly processed and greasy and just...gross. The next thing I noticed are the noodles. They are suppose to be rotini noodles, and yes they are, but they are almost all pieces and little chunks. It's strange. It's bad. The whole thing really feels like left-overs from something else and not in a good way. Sorry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost Expired!. These were incredibly close to their expiration date--they taste stale. Will not buy again online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DANGER! DO NOT GIVE THESE MINTS TO CHILDREN!!! EXTREME PAIN!. DANGER! DO NOT GIVE TO SMALL CHILDREN!! I ate 3 of these and was in terrible pain. I wasn't sure what was wrong with me. I had intense pain thru my jawbone and it wasn't a minty cool burning feeling,this was PAINFUL. I was driving at the time and thought about pulling over. The next day I decided to try a mint again to see if it would happen again. I ate 1 mint and was fine,but then put a 2nd one in and I WAS IN PAIN AGAIN!  I immediately googled complaints and learned I wasn't the only one to experience this. If I gave these mints to my kids when they were little and it caused them this much pain, I would be livid! There is no way a child could handle pain like this, and what if they ate a handful of these things, I cant imagine how terrible it would be for a child. These need to be taken OFF THE MARKET!!!! WHY ARE THEY STILL SELLING THESE THINGS IF THERE IS EVEN A REMOTE POSSIBILITY OF IT CAUSING PAIN TO SOMEONE. And who is going to read a warning label on a pack of mints before consuming it! If it requires a warning it shouldn't be on the market!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awful. Opened them today and they are rancid. Absolutely horrible!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One Star. They were not very fresh--tasted stale & they were eaten quickly after receiving them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But bad lousy tea. Got the shipment on time. But bad lousy tea.<br />Old stale tea even though exp date is not until EOY 2015. Tastes bland. Didnt expect this from a top brand like PG Tips.<br />Bags are much better, as the packaging for loose leaf tea is not up to par. Almost no thought is put into preserving the freshness of the tea by PG Tips loose leaf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry. It was horrible. It did not meet my expectations, and it hurt my girlfriends stomach. She felt sick for a few hour after eatting one half of a bar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first 3 packs were great and tasty. Ordered the 24 pack.  The first 3 packs were great and tasty!  Loved it!  The 4th packet was rotten, brown, moldy,smelly!  Didn't dare eat it!  The 5th packet was the same.  Thru the rest of it out.  Won't re-order, to say the least!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would like them replaced or at lease to receive a refund .... I paid $21 for these pecans and I just opened them -- they are very soft.  The expiration date is listed as December 2015.  I would like them replaced or at lease to receive a refund as I believe them to be inedible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.It tastes like it was made with rotted anchovies..... The taste is okay....Nothing spectacular....It tastes like it was made with rotted anchovies....<br />The main problem: I braised something using this sauce and my apartment stunk like rotted fish for days....<br />The cheap plastic bottle does not make this product more enticing.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tastes nice but gives me a headache every time. I love drinking tea and usually only drink organic loose leaf tea but a friend suggested this tea and said it was safe/healthy. I really enjoy the great taste of this tea but I always end up with a horrible headache after I drink it.<br />After some research,I found out that mighty leaf tea contains toxic levels of fluoride and other harmful chemicals in the tea bags. I wish I would have known this before purchasing a 3 pack of tea that I can't even drink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SodaStream bottle that came with my new SodaStream doesn't expire until July of 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Old product - very stale. I got a package with the old flavors and the product was stale. No flavor at all to these and i have bought them many  times from other sellers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A SOUR, BITTER BREW!. This is the worst tea I have ever tasted. I have been drinking Dragonwell tea daily for decades, it should be nutty and light. This tea is sour and bitter. I tried to return and the company does not take returns or give refunds! DO NOT BUY THIS TEA. It is not drinkable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not for me. I opened package and the corners had small pin size holes. And the bars had a little mold on them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The whole box had expired months ago. I'd had these in the past and they were pretty good so I ordered a box here. This time they tasted...odd.  Checked the expiration date and they were all months expired.  Ick. If you order them check the date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They go bad fast!. I purchased these with my girlfriends account. She was purchasing some things and I thought I'd buy these for a camping trip I had coming up. I opened them to try them and they were delicious! However, when I arrived at my campsite these Turkey sticks had developed mold on them... Very disappointing and dangerous if out in the wild. I highly do not recommend for outdoors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rancid!. Ordered by mistake and WHAT a mistake!  They were old and rancid, dark in color and inedible.  I will NEVER make that mistake again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VERY BAD PURCHASE. These all came in stale and tasteless. I returned what i could but unfortunately i still have a couple of boxes, They are inedible.<br />Pat Schoenfeld,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Very disgusting.. We simply put the bottle in our cabinet when we received it.  We did not open it. A few days later, we see a lot of small round and brown live bugs crawling all over inside the bottle.  Very disgusting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Out dated. arrived open and the date stamp is 8/12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These taste amazing!! Unfortunately they KILL my stomach. These taste amazing!! Unfortunately they KILL my stomach! I am Gluten Free and my stomach hurts as if I ate gluten after eating a KIND bar. After a quick Google search I believe the chicory root fiber is the culprit. Too bad because these bars are a quick easy snack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Personally made me sick. Be careful upset my stomach so bad went to ER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TERRIBLE. One star? More like negative stars. The box that just arrived is probably one of the most disgusting things I've seen: falling apart, covered in white and black mold (yes,seriously). The &#34;box&#34; could barely hold together, it wasn't wet but had obviously been wet and dried - the cardboard was thin and flimsy and falling apart. Sick. Sick. Sick. Unacceptable for any order, but in particular and most importantly, a FOOD item. I should have known reading the other reviews... once I get a refund on these, I'll stick to getting them from Walgreens, thank you very much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One Star. Not good for kids has cancer causing aspartame in it!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stale and yucky. It was stale and all stuck together. I was really disappointed and threw it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expiration date way too early. Stale and dry. Ordered on May 2 as part of my subscribe and save. It arrived on May 23. I didn't notice,but the expiration date was June  13,2015 and even though the product was properly stored, sealed items tasted stale and dry when opened. Will not order again, even though my kids love pretzels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I seriously had to check the label to see if it was expired because the smell was a bit strange and the drink has an off taste-. Chunks of white goo in the drink. I seriously had to check the label to see if it was expired because the smell was a bit strange and the drink has an off taste- it's not like VitaCoco, ONE, or Zico, nor is it like drinking directly from a coconut (given this coconut was in Zanzibar). This tastes artificially sweetened or flavored. It tastes like a chalky protein powder was mixed with a vitamin powder and coconut pulp. Not a good texture or taste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expired 10 months ago!. It's August 2015,and I get a variety pack of bars that expired in October 2014. These belong in the trash!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
